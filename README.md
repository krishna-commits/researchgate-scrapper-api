## How it Works

The main aim of this code is to create a Flask RESTful API that can scrape and provide ResearchGate profile data in a structured JSON format, and Dockerize this Flask application for easier deployment and scalability.

## Running Locally

Your application is now available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api?name=$profile-name of researchgate`.
